With 330 million active users and 500 million tweets a day, Twitter is the world's most popular social media. And due to the character limit imposed on each tweet, the world has learned how to express their feelings in a concise manner. With this, Twitter has become a *gold mine* for data science and Nature Language Processing.

twitter-stats is a dashboard that allows you to search for a twitter user and showcase visualizations made from their tweets. What are their favorite words? Are they generally optimistic or pessimistic? When do they tweet the most?

## Wishlist
1. Create a fake tweet generator to display Markov Chain generated tweets
2. Increase the number of tweets used for each dataset
3. Try a smarter cache system
4. Migrate to React
